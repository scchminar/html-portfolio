<h1>Why I want to get into Coding</h1>
<p>I'd describe myself as a uni dropout who then decided to worked in healthcare as a geriatric nurse.
   Now after 7 years under constant pressure I'm ready to switch career again and learn how to code. It's a new passion, it kinda came out of true intrest. 
   The Internet made knowlegde accessable and the power to get their own education apart form the educational system of their own country. 
   As my political intresst grew - I'd conscider mysself as a leftist - the Internet and Tech holds a great power for the transformation of social classesism.

<p> Yours sincerly A.F.</p>
